This project involves two main parts: Stock Price Prediction using Monte Carlo Simulation and Value at Risk (VaR) Assessment for holding Microsoft (MSFT) shares. Let's break down each part:

Part 1: Stock Price Prediction Model

The goal of this part is to predict MSFT's future stock price using historical data and Monte Carlo simulations.

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
- The project starts by importing over 20 years of Microsoft stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
- From this data, the daily log returns (i.e., percentage changes in the stock price) are calculated.
- Log returns are used in financial modeling due to their desirable mathematical properties.

2. Key Statistical Measures:
- Using the log returns, the mean, standard deviation, and variance of the returns are calculated. These values provide insights into the central tendency and the volatility of the stock price.
- The drift is also calculated, which represents the average rate of return over time, adjusted for variance. Drift helps account for the tendency of the stock to move upwards or downwards over time.

3. Monte Carlo Simulation:
- With the mean and variance of the log returns, the model uses Monte Carlo simulations to generate 10,000 random scenarios.
- Each scenario represents a possible path the stock could take over the next year, assuming the returns follow a normal distribution based on historical returns.
- The simulation provides a range of possible outcomes, from the best-case (highest price) to the worst-case (lowest price) scenarios.

4. Probability Analysis:
- The results of the simulation are analyzed by examining key outcomes:
The best-case scenario: The highest possible price.
The worst-case scenario: The lowest possible price.
The average stock price.
- Additionally, the project looks at the 68% probability range which represents one standard deviation of outcomes in a normal distribution and the 95% probability range, showing where the stock price is likely to fall with those levels of confidence.

Part 2: Value at Risk (VaR) Assessment Model

This part assesses the financial risk of holding Microsoft stock for one month, using Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the Value at Risk (VaR).

1. Data and Parameters:
In this model, the analysis is based on 30 days of historical MSFT price data.
Instead of directly analyzing this data, key statistics are extracted, particularly the volatility (i.e., the standard deviation of returns) and the current value of the investment (the price of MSFT shares at the start of the period).

2. Simulating Investment Returns:
- Using the historical volatility and other parameters, the model simulates 5,000 potential investment returns for a portfolio holding 1,000 shares of MSFT for a one-month period.
- These simulations model the possible outcomes of the stock's price movements over the 30-day holding period.

3. VaR Calculation:
- Based on the distribution of the simulated returns, the project calculates Value at Risk (VaR) at three different confidence levels: 90%, 95%, and 99%.
- VaR is a risk measure that indicates the maximum potential loss of the portfolio (in this case, 1,000 MSFT shares) over a specified period (30 days), given a certain confidence level.
90% confidence level VaR means that, in 9 out of 10 scenarios, the loss will not exceed this amount.
95% confidence level VaR means that, in 19 out of 20 scenarios, the loss will not exceed this amount.
99% confidence level VaR means that in 99 out of 100 scenarios, the loss will not exceed this amount.

Conclusion:

Part 1 (Stock Price Prediction) uses Monte Carlo simulations to generate potential future prices of MSFT stock based on historical data, helping to visualize the range of possible stock price movements over the next year. This gives insight into how the stock could perform under various conditions.

Part 2 (VaR Assessment) assesses the risk of holding MSFT stock for a one-month period. By simulating 5,000 possible outcomes, the model provides a Value at Risk measure, indicating the potential loss at different confidence levels (90%, 95%, and 99%).

This project combines financial modeling (predicting future stock prices) and risk management (assessing potential losses) to provide a comprehensive view of the investment's risk and potential outcomes.
